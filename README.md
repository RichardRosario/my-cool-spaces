# My Cool Spaces

## This is a simple javascript project for a property agent client who deals with house furnitures and spaces for rent. This is the base app.. it will be extended to offer more functionality in the future.

### This is purely made in vanilla javascript and I intend to develop the rest of the funtionalities in vanilla javascript if possible.. if not, I will be using reactjs.

### Funtionality:

#### display properties and space for rents with DOM traversing, add space to cart, increase-decrease number of days, show items in cart, remove items in cart, add total amount.

#### Future functionalities:

Create account
Update account
Delete account
Take data and save t0 on mongoDB or MySql
Create an admin area
Create a blog functionality for content marketing and SEO
and many more...

Please suggest functionalities you might want to see created.

#### responsive layout using css grid
